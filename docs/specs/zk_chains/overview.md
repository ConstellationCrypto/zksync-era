# Overview

ZK Chains will be launched on L1 into a set of [ecosystem contracts](./ecosystem-contracts.md). The ecosystem contracts
supports the ecosystem of chains, enabling shared standards, upgrades, and free flow of assets. This free flow of assets
will be enabled by direct cross-chain [interop](./interop.md), which will allow cheap general cross-chain function
calls. To enable seamless settlement to L1, and fast interop, chains can choose to settle on the
[ZK Gateway](./gateway.md).
